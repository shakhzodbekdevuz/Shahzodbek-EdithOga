                Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White
                 South African father, and raised in Pretoria,
                  South Africa. He briefly attended the University 
                  of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17. He matriculated 
                  at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania 
                  two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in Economics and 
                  Physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but
                   decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software 
                   company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for 
                   $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which
                    merged with Confinity in 
                2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
